The rank-1 update on a symmetric eigenvalue problem is tested here for the first case of Ïƒ = 0
Following random diagonal matrix D is generated:
     0.618          0          0          0          0 
         0       0.45          0          0          0 
         0          0      0.369          0          0 
         0          0          0       0.26          0 
         0          0          0          0       0.11 
And the computed Eigenvalues for A is found to be:
Eigenvalue 1: 0.617813208428124
Eigenvalue 2: 0.449811546341428
Eigenvalue 3: 0.369076476138586
Eigenvalue 4: 0.260489464858775
Eigenvalue 5: 0.11034898139087
